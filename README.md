# A/B Test Results Analysis
In this project, I worked on the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  

The analysis is based on three approches:  
- Probability
- A/B Test
- Logistic Regression

## Requirements
Python 3.6 (or higher)  
matplotlib 2.1 (or higher)  
numpy 1.10 (or higher)  
pandas 0.20 (or higher)
