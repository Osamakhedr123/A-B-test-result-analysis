# A/B Test Result Analysis
In this project, I worked on the result of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to help the company decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  

The analysis is based on three approaches:  
- Probability
- Hypothesis Testing
- Logistic Regression
